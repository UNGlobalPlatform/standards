Principles
The Principles

**Utility computing:** We prefer to use services that can be provided to us by a third party as a utility (rather like a metered service based on need) as opposed to creating or managing services ourselves.

*Rationale: increases flexibility; reduces capital and revenue costs; maximises accessibility and collaboration; allows access regardless of location 24 hours a day, seven days a week; supports partnership working and shared services.*

**Reuse:** ICT will be made up of components that can be used in many different situations and shared more widely between different parts of the UN and partners, rather than each problem or requirement being addressed individually.

*Rationale: supports the development of key, corporate sources of data; reduces development time; removes duplication of functions and data; increases accuracy of information; increases reliability of data and systems; reduces management costs.*

**Single identity:** Access to all ICT services and electronic information will be through a single electronic identity. This means there will be a single sign-on for all services required by the user.

*Rationale: simplifies user access; simplifies user management; abstracts authentication from individual systems.*

**Personalisation:** Everyone will be treated as an individual and we will provide each person with their own tailored experience of our services and information. We will support personal data stores so people can store, access and use the information they need to carry out their daily roles.

*Rationale: removes complexity; allows customers and staff to focus on what is important to them; increases individual efficiency; puts customers in control of their own data.*

**Open Standards:** We strongly prefer technologies that are openly available, rather than the exclusive property or product of a particular company or organisation.

*Rationale: reduces costs; simplifies integration; increases flexibility*

**Risk based approach:** We will make decisions on how to provide services based on a balanced understanding of risk and reward.

*Rationale: ensures appropriate security is supplied; avoids over-engineered solutions; strikes an appropriate balance between control and business need; supports innovation and opportunity.*

**Any user device:** We will provide our services to any appropriate and suitably secured device, whether or not it is owned and managed by the UN.

*Rationale: increases user choice and flexibility; removes dependence on specific devices; reduces device costs; minimises device management costs; maintains appropriate levels of security.*

**Electronic Information and data are open by default:** We will treat all non-personal and non-sensitive information openly and transparently. We will open information to everyone and provide methods for anyone to access it.

*Rationale: encourages good governance; meets expectations in relation to open government; encourages innovative use of public domain data and information; reduces requests for information and related staff costs; ensures better service delivery.*

**Start with needs:** The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real user needs. We should design around those. We must understand those needs thoroughly — interrogating data, not just making assumptions — and we should remember that what users ask for is not always what they need.

**Iterate. Then iterate again:** The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real users, move from Alpha to Beta to Launch adding features and refinements based on feedback from real users.

**Build for inclusion:** Accessible design is good design. We should build a product that’s as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to sacrifice elegance — so be it. We shouldn’t be afraid of the obvious, shouldn’t try to reinvent web design conventions and should set expectations clearly.

**Make things open: it makes things better:** We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets — howlers get spotted, better alternatives get pointed out, the bar gets raised.
